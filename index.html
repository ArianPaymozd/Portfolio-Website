              <p>Hi, I'm Arian Yazdi. Welcome to my portfolio website! So a little bit about me. When I'm not programing my favorite thing to do is skateboard. I actualy think it's very similar to programing in that you now what you want your final result to look like, and in order to get there you need to try and fail until you figure it out. A few other things I enjoy doing are making music with my friends, building things out of wood or metal, and binging my favorite Netflix shows. Oh, and once in a while I even leave the house!</p>
              <p>
                I would say my main personality traits are my desire to get along with everyone and my love for solving problems, both of which I think come from my father. From a young age hed always tell me two things, "if you disagree with 99% of someones opinions, then talk about the other percent." and "don't talk about problems you're not trying to solve." It was engrained in me to solve not only my own problems but any problem that's presented to me, and it made problem solving one of my favorite activities. I think that trait along with my ability to get along with everyone makes me a valuable part of any team im a part of.

                  I fell in love with coding after taking a Skillshare course on python. It was one of those "aha" moments where everything just seems to click. At the time I wasn't sure what my career would be so it seemed like it was meant to be, I decided to jump in with both feet and have loved every moment since.

                  I'm so excited to start working with other developers on projects since I've always felt I work better in a group. I don't know a lot of people wo also love programing and It would be really great to talk about project and ideas with other people who probably won't look at me like im crazy!
